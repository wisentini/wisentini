### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marcos and this is my GitHub profile. You can use this resource to get to know the way I approach and solve problems with programming. Here you can find my side projects as well as some material from my journey as an Information Systems undergrad at Federal University of Santa Maria.
